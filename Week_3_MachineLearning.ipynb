The techniques mentioned in this notebook apply not only to classification problems, but to regression problems and problems dealing with other types of input data as well. I provide an introduction to a few key machine learning models and the logic in choosing their hyperparameters. These objectives are framed by the task of recognizing emotion from snippets of speech audio.\n","\n"," Training data should be used strictly for training a model, validation data strictly for tuning a model, and test data strictly to evaluate a model once it is tuned - a model should never be tuned to perform better on test data.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Classic machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), k Nearest Neighbours (kNN), and Random Forests have distinct advantages to deep neural networks in many tasks."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QQsTfGREL9g1"},"source":["<!--TABLE OF CONTENTS-->\n","\n","\n","# Table of Contents\n","  - [Intro: Speech Emotion Recognition on the RAVDESS dataset](#Intro:-Speech-Emotion-Recognition-on-the-RAVDESS-dataset)\n","  - [Machine Learning Process Overview](#Machine-Learning-Process-Overview)\n","  - [Feature Extraction](#Feature-Extraction)\n","    - [Load the Dataset and Compute Features](#Load-the-Dataset-and-Compute-Features)\n","    - [Feature Scaling](#Feature-Scaling)\n","  - [Classical Machine Learning Models](#Classical-Machine-Learning-Models)\n","    - [Training: The 80/20 Split and Validation](#Training:-The-80/20-Split-and-Validation)\n","    - [Comparing Models](#Comparing-Models)\n","    - [The Support Vector Machine Classifier](#The-Support-Vector-Machine-Classifier)\n","    - [k Nearest Neighbours](#k-Nearest-Neighbours)\n","    - [Random Forests](#Random-Forests)\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"},"id":"hZUcbr4PL9g2"},"source":["## Intro: Speech Emotion Recognition on the RAVDESS dataset\n","In this notebook we explore the most common machine learning models, specifically those available off the shelf in scikit-learn.\n","\n","I'm going to use the RAVDESS dataset (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song dataset), created by Steven Livingstone and Frank Russo of Ryerson University. <br>\n","[Details of the RAVDESS dataset](https://smartlaboratory.org/ravdess/) <br>\n","[Download the dataset used in this notebook](https://zenodo.org/record/1188976) <br> Scroll half-way down the page and find \"Audio_Speech_Actors_01-24\"<br>\n","\n","We're going to use the audio-only speech portion of the RAVDESS dataset, ~200MB.\n","Audio is sourced from 24 actors (12 male, 12 female) repeating two sentences with\n","a variety of emotions and intensity.

First is the support vector machine classifier (SVC) - a model from the 60s. SVMs are models quick to train for this task and best suited to small datasets due to its quadratic time complexity w.r.t. size of the training dataset (# of training samples). This is also the reason it breaks down with larger datasets since it becomes very expensive to train.\n","\n","The idea behind SVMs on which the SVC model is based is to find a separating hyperplane - a subspace with dimension one less than that of the feature space - for points in our feature space; i.e. for a 3D space, a hyperplane is a regular plane, in 2D, a line. This idea extends to n dimensions. If points are separable by a hyperplane, they are said to be linearly separable. **Since there are infinite possible separating hyperplanes for any linearly separable feature space, an SVM computes which points are closest to each such hyperplane and uses them to construct a _support vector_. The SVM picks the hyperplane which maximizes the distance - _margin_ - to each support vector.** In this way, we maximize the separating ability of the chosen hyperplane.\n","\n","The core of SVMs is the kernel. We could map all new points from our input space, where they were not separable by a hyperplane, to a higher dimension in which we have found a hyperplane to separate the points in that space. However, that would be extremely computationally expensive for data that needs to be mapped to much higher dimensions. Instead, we **compute the hyperplane in the higher dimension on our training data and map the hyperplane back to the lower-dimension input space to use for classifying our data. This is the _kernel trick_, whereby the kernel (function) enables us to compute distances to new points in the input space without transforming each to the higher dimensional space - drastically reducing the computational complexity of the SVM.**\n","\n"," <img src=\"https://github.com/IAT-ExploringAI-2024/Week3-Machine_Learning/blob/main/images/kernel1.png?raw=true\" width=\"800\">"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"r-VTE6HjL9hf"},"source":["A linear kernel should always be tested because **a linear kernel is much faster to train than a non-linear kernel**; however, properly tuned, a non-linear kernel often provides the best possible predictive performance. **RBF (radial basis function) is a good default to use for a non-linear kernel** and often is the best non-linear kernel because it usually provides a higher accuracy compared to other non-linear kernels at the cost of higher computational complexity.

This random selection of features makes Random Forests robust to outliers**, as such features will have less of an impact in the scope of the entire forest, most of whose trees operate on the \"real\" features.\n","\n","**Random Forests are excellent models to use as a benchmark due to their low time complexity to train and because it is an ensemble method, their robustness to unknown distributions and outliers in the dataset,** meaning Random Forests require relatively little exploratory analysis in both the data and training the model to get an idea of their performance in a task.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/IliaZenkov/sklearn-audio-classification/blob/master/img/randomforest.png?raw=true\" width=500 height=500 />"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":206,"metadata":{"id":"j9BWmcV9L9hh","outputId":"c3aafd18-b211-4791-8dd2-6b1d6bd3a4b8","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1759027132178,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":33200,"user":{"displayName":"Veeraj Mishra","userId":"10686935763976120253"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Default Random Forest Model's accuracy on training set is 100.00%\n","Default Random Forest Model's accuracy on test set is 55.17%\n","\n","Random Forest Model's accuracy on training set is 100.00%\n","Random Forest Model's accuracy on test set is 60.34%\n"]}],"source":["from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n","\n","####### Default Random Forest ########\n","model = RandomForestClassifier(\n","    random_state=69\n",")\n","\n","model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n","\n","print(f'Default Random Forest Model\\'s accuracy on training set is {100*model.score(X_train, y_train):.2f}%')\n","print(f'Default Random Forest Model\\'s accuracy on test set is {100*model.score(X_test, y_test):.2f}%\\n')\n","\n","\n","########## Tuned Random Forest #######\n","model = RandomForestClassifier(\n","    n_estimators = 500,\n","    criterion ='entropy',\n","    warm_start = True,\n","    max_features = 'sqrt',\n","    oob_score = True, # more on this below\n","    random_state=42\n",")\n","\n","model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n","\n","print(f'Random Forest Model\\'s accuracy on training set is {100*model.score(X_train, y_train):.2f}%')\n","print(f'Random Forest Model\\'s accuracy on test set is {100*model.score(X_test, y_test):.2f}%')"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n","\n","####### Default Random Forest ########\n","model = RandomForestClassifier(\n","    random_state=69\n",")\n","\n","model.fit(X_train1, y_train1)\n","\n","print(f'Default Random Forest Model\\'s accuracy on training set is {100*model.score(X_train1, y_train1):.2f}%')\n","print(f'Default Random Forest Model\\'s accuracy on test set is {100*model.score(X_test1, y_test1):.2f}%\\n')\n","\n","\n","########## Tuned Random Forest #######\n","model = RandomForestClassifier(\n","    n_estimators = 500,\n","    criterion ='entropy',\n","    warm_start = True,\n","    max_features = 'sqrt',\n","    oob_score = True, # more on this below\n","    random_state=42\n",")\n","\n","model.fit(X_train1, y_train1)\n","\n","print(f'Random Forest Model\\'s accuracy on training set is {100*model.score(X_train1, y_train1):.2f}%')\n","print(f'Random Forest Model\\'s accuracy on test set is {100*model.score(X_test1, y_test1):.2f}%')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Hsr1x0JkL4s_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1759027147570,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":1283,"user":{"displayName":"Veeraj Mishra","userId":"10686935763976120253"}},"outputId":"daeb9674-420e-42a3-ffa0-d291af42975b"},"execution_count":207,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Default Random Forest Model's accuracy on training set is 100.00%\n","Default Random Forest Model's accuracy on test set is 0.00%\n","\n","Random Forest Model's accuracy on training set is 100.00%\n","Random Forest Model's accuracy on test set is 0.00%\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vM9-k8KLL9hi"},"source":["Not bad for zero effort put into the default model. **Random Forests make a good benchmark model**, especially when strapped for time.\n","\n","**_Max features_ defines size of random feature subset decided upon at each node; sqrt(#features) is a good default for classification.**\n","\n","**_Gini_ and _Entropy_ are functions computing quality of classified samples within each node; they almost always provide similar performance but Entropy is more suited to classification while Gini is better for continuous variables.**\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DnhnxuGXL9hi"},"source":["\n","As wonderful as Random Forests are, it's clear that we're going to need to pull out bigger guns if we want to get appreciable performance on this dataset, perhaps even with good generalizability on test data.
